#### Hello! :wave:

I am a student at St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY.

I am majoring in both Computer Science and Statistics.

I compete in NCAA D1 Nordic Skiing ❄️ and D3 Outdoor Track and Field 🏃 for St. Lawrence University.

I am currently interested in Cybersecurity and doing independent learning related to that.
