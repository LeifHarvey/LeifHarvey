I am a junior at St. Lawrence University studying Computer Science and Statistics. As a Computer Science major, I am excited by Software Development and Cybersecurity; I plan on engaging with those fields in the future. Recently, I've enjoyed exploring the world of web security and pondering how to build safer networks.

I also compete in NCAA DI Nordic Skiing on the EISA circuit and on the DIII level for Outdoor Track, where I focus on the 400m and 800m races.
