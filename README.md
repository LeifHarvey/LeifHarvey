I am a junior at St. Lawrence University studying Computer Science and Statistics. As a Computer Science major, I am excited by Software Development, Blockchain, and Cybersecurity; I plan on engaging with those fields in the future. I have just completed an internship with L.L.Bean, where I worked with the IS Customer Technology team maintaining the content and functionality of the website's front end.

I also compete in NCAA DI Nordic Skiing on the EISA circuit and on the DIII level for Outdoor Track, where I focus on the 400m, 800m, and 4x400m races.
